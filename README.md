This is my attempt at writing my own C driver for IT8951 e-paper display driver IC.
It is based on a Waveshare project (that I wasn't able to get to work).
[Repository](https://github.com/waveshare/IT8951)
[Wiki](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/6inch_e-Paper_HAT)
With this driver I was able to clear the display but printing an image never worked properly.
